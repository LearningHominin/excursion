## Excursion Project from Codecademy

This is my project that I made while studying the Git/Github course on Codecademy that can be found at: [excursion](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/projects/f1-excursion).

At the time of writing the project, I did not know much about html or CSS, but tried to play with things so that I can understand the code. Please refer to the link about the project before reading the way I've implemented the project. you can also find 2 pcitures of how the project should look like in the main branch.

### About the project:

* As you'll see, the main branch has only a very primitive state of the html. The actual project can be found in the ideas branch, where I've included the video; images and CSS link.
* You'll also notice that the links in the projects are red instead of aquamarine and the Copyright Excursion footer is to the left instead of to the right. That is my playwork with the CSS code. I wanted to test things out.
* Aside from the html/CSS code, the project also required the deployment of the .html file onto a web page. You can find the viewable web page here: [result](http://LearningHominin.github.io/excursion).
